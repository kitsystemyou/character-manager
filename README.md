# character-manager
Character Manager was made for managing TRPG character sheets.
There are vairious TRPG game systems and characters in each systems. We'd like to create the web application for them.
Now, there are some web app for managing character sheets (e.g. ) but they manage only one game system, or has legayc infra system.
So We try to create character manage web app which manage all game system characters and has modern infra system.
